To get started with this demo course, view the \n\n\n\n<a href=\"/course/courseware/d8a6192ade314473a78242dfeedfbf5b/hebs_introduction/\">courseware page</a> and click &#8220;Example Week 1&#8221; in the left hand navigation.  \n\n\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\nWe tried to make this both fun and informative. We hope you like it.  &#8211; The HEBS Team \n\n\n",
