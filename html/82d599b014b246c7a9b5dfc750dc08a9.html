<p><img alt="Getting Started" src="/static/getting-started_x250.png" width="250" />Welcome to the first week of the sample HEBS&nbsp;Course! We created this to give you &ldquo;the basics&rdquo; of how courses work at&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">HEBS</span>. Almost all&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">HEBS&nbsp;</span>courses have weeks, lessons, lectures, homework assignments,&nbsp;and&nbsp;exams. This demo course has three example weeks &ndash; most courses last 4 to 12 weeks.</p>
<p>You are in Week 1, Lesson 1. Lessons typically include things like videos, readings, interactive questions, laboratories and more. &nbsp;These are presented from left to right, in&nbsp;the row of links above. At&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">HEBS&nbsp;</span>we call this a <em>lesson</em> or a <em>learning sequence.</em></p>
<p>Explore the lesson sequence by clicking on the icons above or the arrows below.&nbsp; We tried to make these fun, so make sure to check out each item. &nbsp;</p>
