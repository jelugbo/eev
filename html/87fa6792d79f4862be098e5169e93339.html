<h2>Find Your Study Buddy</h2>
<p>Working with other students offline can help you get the most out of an HEBS&nbsp;course and even increase the likelihood you will successfully complete the course. So, your homework is to find a study buddy.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/HEBS-Communities/">HEBS Meetup Community</a> is a fantastic way to find study buddies in your area. Meetups make it easy for students to organize get-togethers or study sessions in coffee shops and cafes, libraries, or at local schools. If there isn&rsquo;t a HEBS&nbsp;Meetup Community in your area, you can easily start one up.</p>
<p>Here are some Meetup Communities near you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[ BOX ]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course specific discussion forums are also a great place to find neighbors or even new friends to invite to a Meetup you are looking to organize or even a virtual Google Hangout. Make sure you also join the HEBS&nbsp;community on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HEBSOnline">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/108235383044095082735/108235383044095082735">Google+</a> or <a href="http://vk.com/edxrussia">Vkontakte</a> and to share with friends your HEBS experience. You may even inspire a friend to join HEBS&nbsp;and enroll in the course with you.</p>
